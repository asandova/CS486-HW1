1 Implement an algorithm for the Frequent Words Problem. 
1.1 Write down the pseudocode on paper first. You do not have to implement a very fast algorithm at this time. Any algorithm that gives the correct results is acceptable.
1.2 The program must be able to take an input text file and and a value k to specify the number characters in the word. The program will print the most frequent words on the screen. You must write your own computer code. 
1.3 Implement five test cases that you know the answer. The program should print out error messages if a test cases failed. The tests should be run first before it processes any input file.
1.4 Show the runtime as a function of the input text length. Plot the curve in R or another tool that you are familiar with.
1.5 Write a readme file to describe how to run the code.
2 Write a program to detect the oriC by checking the difference in frequencies of G and C. The input is a DNA string file (representing a circular genome). The output is a coordinate in the input genome that is most likely the site of oriC. 
2.1 Please describe the pseudocode. 
2.2 Design five test cases to check the correctness of your code.
2.3 Write a readme file to describe how to run the code.
